dependence:
    This tool is using gitPython. So you have to install that python lib first.
    I developed it on python27 and not yet testing it on any other version of python.

usage:
    Excute git_compare.py followed by two commit numbers to be compared. The local git directory and compare root directory are specified in config.ini. The difference between the two given commits are given in to directories a and b in the compare root you specified.
